- File Manager with WYSIWYG editors (code and graphics) and Cloud Storage (Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, FTP) 
- X-Update Manager to deploy from stores in GitHub, Gitlab or any other public or private, local or remote repository

Self-hosted platforms are decentralized, allow for superior accessibility for customizing functions and style, which means you are not dependent on a centralized service and are free to choose your hosting service. This allows for extreme mobility when your number of users increase.
