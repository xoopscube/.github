<h1>The XOOPSCube Project</h1>

### Simple, Secure and Scalable

### Web Application Platform

XOOPSCube is a self-hosted open source application that runs on the most popular web server stack - Apache, MySQL, PHP. Self-hosted platforms are decentralized, allow for superior accessibility for customizing functions and style, which means you are not dependent on a centralized service and are free to choose your hosting service. This allows for extreme mobility when your number of users increase.
