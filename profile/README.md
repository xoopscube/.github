### Simple, Secure and Scalable — Web Application Platform

XOOPSCUBE Legacy (XCL) stands as a free and open-source Web Application Platform (WAP, CMS), providing webmasters with the power to effortlessly build dynamic and content-rich websites. The user-friendly XCL bundle package is engineered to leverage the performance of the XCube Core alongside the widely adopted web server stack: Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Installation is a breeze – simply clone the repository or extract the ZIP archive into a directory within your website's root, open your web browser, and launch the intuitive installation wizard, available in English, Français, 日本語, Português, Pусский.

**XCL Bundle Package — out of the box**   

One of the key advantages of a general-purpose web application with a low-code development approach is the ease of self-installation through a straightforward installation wizard. The web-based Control Panel offers a user-friendly experience, and its intuitive interface simplifies the management of multiple instances, user permissions, content, and updates. Forget the hassle of separately downloading and manually uploading archives – the integrated X-Update Manager provides one-click functionality to effortlessly acquire and deploy add-ons.

* **Scalability:** Achieve growth without the burden of expensive contracts, hidden cloud hosting costs, limitations, or restrictions.
* **Integrated Features:** Benefit from a built-in Content Management System, efficient Caching, Duplicatable Modules for multi-site management, robust User Groups Management, customizable Themes, and a convenient built-in Search function.
* **Versatile File Management:** Manage files effortlessly with WYSIWYG editors, code and graphics editing capabilities, and GUI-based cloud storage integration for Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and FTP.
* **Effortless Updates & Add-ons:** Utilize the X-Update Manager to easily acquire and deploy add-ons from various sources, including GitHub, GitLab, and any other public, private, local, or remote repository, all with a single click.
* **Flexible Customization:** Enjoy the freedom of customized frontend and backend development, a framework-agnostic architecture, single file components, and simplified localization through a graphical user interface for translations.
* **Simplified Content Creation:** Empower users with no-code and low-code content creation tools, integrated forums, knowledge management features, the ability to host multiple blogs (e.g., WordPress integration), and the option to wrap existing HTML pages.

Self-hosted platforms offer a decentralized approach, granting users significant control over customization of both functions and style. This independence means you're not tied to a centralized service and have the freedom to select your preferred hosting provider. This autonomy translates to exceptional scalability as your user base grows, allowing you to adapt and expand your resources according to your specific needs without the limitations often imposed by centralized platforms.
